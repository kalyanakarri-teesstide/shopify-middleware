# Shopify Middleware Service

This is a Node.js-based backend service that receives Shopify order webhooks and forwards the order data to a mock ERP system. It also exposes an API endpoint (`/orders`) to fetch the synced orders for display in a frontend UI.

---

## Features

- Receives real-time Shopify order data via webhooks.
- Transforms Shopify order payload into a simplified ERP-compatible format.
- Sends the transformed order to a mock ERP (Webhook.site or real ERP endpoint).
- Stores synced orders in memory.
- Provides a GET `/orders` endpoint for a frontend to display synced orders.
